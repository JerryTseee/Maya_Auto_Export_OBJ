These Python script can fully automate the procedure of importing animation sequences into Maya and then exporting OBJ files into the selected directory  
"Maya_Automate_Export_OBJ" is used to output the OBJ files according to the imported animation sequences  
"Maya_Automate_Import_Sequence" is used to import the animation sequence into the Maya from a new sequence json file  
"Maya_Automation_Full" is combining all the above two processes into one single file, and achieved the goal of importing sequence and exporting OBJ files  (video as demonstration)  
"Maya_Auto_Multiple_Export" can be used to import multiple animation sequences of the same character and then export the corresponding OBJ files simultaneouslt  
"Maya_Auto_Multiple_Export_Version2" only uses sequence file to import animation sequence and find frame value
